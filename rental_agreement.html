    <h3><u>NEW YORK:</u></h3>

    <p>Loss Damage Waiver. This contract offers, for an additional charge, optional vehicle protection to cover your financial responsibility for damage or loss to the rental vehicle. The purchase of optional vehicle protection is optional and may be declined. You are advised to carefully consider whether to purchase this protection if you have rental vehicle collision coverage provided by your credit card or automobile insurance policy. Before deciding whether to purchase optional vehicle protection, you may wish to determine whether your credit card or your vehicle insurance affords you coverage for damage to the rental vehicle and the amount of deductible under such coverage.</p>

    <p>Failure to completely and accurately fill out and return an incident report within ten days of receipt of this notice may make the authorized driver liable for damages sustained to the rental vehicle. Except where the damaged vehicle is determined to be a total loss and subject to salvage, the authorized driver or his or her insurer has seventy-two hours from the return of the vehicle to notify the rental vehicle company that he or she wishes to inspect the damaged vehicle. The inspection must be completed within seven business days of the return date of the vehicle. If the authorized driver or his or her insurer does not request this inspection within the seventy-two-hour period, the authorized driver or his or her insurer will be deemed to have waived this right. If the rental vehicle company determines the damaged vehicle to be a total loss and subject to salvage, such seventy-two hour period for notification or waiver of the wish to inspect the damaged vehicle shall not apply, and such right to inspect the damaged vehicle shall expire ten business days from the authorized driver's receipt of this notice from the rental vehicle company at the return of the vehicle or receipt of the first mailing of this notice in the event of return of the vehicle by automation or after hours. Upon request of the authorized driver or his or her insurer, we will provide a copy of our estimate of the costs of repairing the damaged motor vehicle.</p>

New York State Law prohibits the following practices by rental vehicle companies based upon race, color, ethnic origin, religion, disability, sex, marital status, or age: (1) refusal to rent; (2) the imposition of any additional charge (except in certain instances where the renter is under the age of 25). In addition, it is unlawful for any rental vehicle company to refuse to rent a vehicle to any person solely on the requirement of ownership of a credit card.</p>

    <h3>14. Who May Drive the Car</h3>

    <p>You represent to RRR SUV RENTALthat you are a capable and validly licensed driver and will remain a capable and validly licensed driver throughout the term of your rental.

Any person other than you or a Permitted Driver that operates the car must sign an additional driver form at the time of the rental. We may charge for each additional driver authorized to drive the car, which will be specified on the Rental Contract. You acknowledge that you will always remain financially responsible under the Rental Agreement even if the car is operated by a Permitted Driver or someone other than yourself.</p>

    <h3>15. Return of the Car</h3>

    <p>You agree to return the car to us in the same condition you received it, ordinary wear and tear excepted, on the date, at the time and to the location specified in the Rental Contract. You must return it sooner on our demand. If you return it earlier or later, a different or higher rental rate may apply and, if returned later, you may also be charged a late return fee. You may not return the car outside of the return location's operating hours unless specifically allowed by that location.  If you do, your responsibility for damage to or loss of the car will continue, and all charges stated on the Rental Contract as a periodic rate will continue to accrue until the return location reopens and we process the return of the car. Operating hours vary by location. If we do not find the car when that location opens, your responsibility for all charges and for damage to or loss of the car will continue until the car is returned or recovered. If you wish to extend any rental you must contact us at (877) 773-6878or use a method, we approve to request the extension before your return date. We may or may not grant an extension or decline to grant it for the entire period you request, in our sole discretion.

If we do grant an extension a different or higher rate may be applied to the extension period and a service fee may also apply.</p>

    <h3>16. Where You’ll Return the Car</h3>

    <p>The car must be returned to the agreed return location as specified on the Rental Contract. </p>

    <h3>17. Rental Charges</h3>

    <p>You will pay for the number of miles/kilometers you drive and the period of time you rent the car at the rate indicated on the Rental Contract, or your applicable corporate rate. Unless otherwise indicated on the Rental Contract, the minimum charge is one day (24 hours), unless “calendar day” is indicated on the Rental Contract, plus mileage/kilometer age, or a fixed fee. We will determine the miles/kilometers by reading the factory-installed odometer or utilize the vehicle's telematics device. The daily charge applies to consecutive 24-hour periods starting at the hour and minute the rental begins or, if a calendar day is specified on the Rental Contract, each consecutive calendar day or any part of a calendar day starting on the calendar day on which the rental occurs. If you fail to comply with any conditions for special rates specified on the Rental Contract our otherwise applicable rates will be charged. You’ll pay all charges that apply to the rental for miscellaneous services and, where permitted, airport facility fees and/or concession recovery fees, vehicle license recovery fees, other fees, and surcharges.</p>

    <p>a) If you present any rewards certificates, coupons or vouchers associated with a loyalty rewards program, you will be charged a ZERO fee. </p>

    <p class="text-danger">b) You will also pay a reasonable fee for cleaning the car’s interior upon return if any stains, dirt, odor, or soiling attributable to your use cannot be cleaned with our standard post-rental procedures as determined by us in our sole discretion.</p>

    <p>c) If the key(s) or key fob(s) are not returned with the car, you may be charged additional fees.</p>

    <p class="text-danger">d) We maintain a non-smoking fleet, including a prohibition on the use of e-cigarettes in the car. You will pay an additional charge if you return the car, and it smells or is soiled from smoke or e-cigarette vapor.</p>

    <p>e) You and any third party to whom any rental charges are billed, such as an insurer or employer, are jointly and severally responsible for payment of all such charges. If you direct us to bill any such charges to a third party, you represent that you are authorized to do so on behalf of the third party.</p>

    <p>f) If you use a car with automatic toll payment capability, see the disclosures regarding “e-Toll" in terms of use.</p>

    <p>g) To the extent you utilize any rate/benefit discount code in association with a rental, you represent you meet the requisite criteria for utilizing such discount code. Any other use will be viewed as an unlawful use and theft of services for which RRR SUV RENTAL can pursue legal remedies, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, and may void any associated discounts or rental benefits.</p>

    <p>h)  RRR SUV RENTAL makes every effort to ensure that all prices and descriptions quoted on its website or elsewhere are correct and accurate. However, in the case of a manifest error or omission, RRR SUV RENTAL reserves the right to rescind the Rental Agreement, even if we have already accepted your reservation and/or received your payment. Our liability in that event will be limited to the return of any money that you have paid with respect to the reservation. In the case of a manifest error in which we permit you to keep your reservation, we reserve the right to require that you pay the difference between the quoted price and the correct price, as confirmed in writing by RRR SUV RENTAL after the manifest error has been discovered. A "manifest error", as the term is used in this paragraph, means, in relation to an incorrect price, a price quoted in error by RRR SUV RENTALwhich is more than 15% less than the price that would have been quoted had the mistake not been made.</p>

    <h3>18. Taxes, Surcharges & Fees</h3>

    <p>You’ll also pay all applicable taxes as well as any additional charges provided on the Rental Agreement which are over and above the base rental rate. These may be surcharges and/or recovery fees to recover certain costs.</p>

    <h3>19. Card Reserve</h3>

    <p>You acknowledge that you have been informed that if you use a charge card (including any digital wallet or mobile payment application linked to your charge card account), your credit, up to an amount of the estimated total charges due under the Rental Agreement, as indicated on the Rental Contract, based on your representations about this rental, may be set aside or reserved by the card issuer of the card, which you present for payment of your rental charges; or, if you use a debit card funds in the account to which that card is linked may be set aside for the greater of the amount of the estimated total charges due under the Rental Agreement, based on your representations about this rental, as indicated on the Rental Contract, or the deposit amount indicated on signs at the location at which you rent the car at the time of rental. You consent to the reservation or setting aside of that estimated total amount at the time of commencement of the rental. You understand that we will authorize the release of any excess reserve or set aside upon the completion of your rental (return of the car and our determination of whether any additional fees or charges apply), and that your card issuer’s rules apply to your credit line, or your account being credited for such excess and may not be immediately released by your card issuer.</p>

    <h3>20. Repossessing the Car</h3>

    <p>We can repossess the car at any time in our sole discretion for reasons that include but are not limited to the following: the car is found illegally parked, being used to violate the law or the terms of the Rental Agreement or appears to be abandoned. You agree that we need not notify you in advance and that we may take any actions reasonably necessary to obtain possession of the car, including remotely disabling the engine, remotely locking the doors, tracking the location of the car through GPS tracking devices and utilizing for our benefit any other devices connected to the car or affecting the car's operation. If the car is repossessed, you agree to pay or reimburse us for the actual and reasonable costs incurred by us to repossess the car. You agree that such costs will be charged to the credit or debit card or account you used to rent the car.</p>

    <h3>21. Loss Damage Waiver (LDW). </h3>

    <p>Loss Damage Waiver (LDW) is not insurance and is not mandatory. If you accept full LDW by your initials on the Rental Contract at the additional daily rate, for each full or partial day that the car is rented to you, and the car is operated in accordance with this agreement, we assume responsibility for the loss of or damage to the car except, if permitted by law, for lost, damaged or stolen keys or remote entry devices, towing or tire services unless related to an accident, or recovery of the car if stolen, (except in the state of Alaska), and except for your amount of “responsibility”, if any, specified on the Rental Contract. Partial Loss Damage Waiver (PDW) is available only where permitted by law. If you accept PDW at the indicated daily rate, and the car is operated in accordance with the Rental Agreement, we assume responsibility for the loss or damage to the car up to the amount as specified on the Rental Contract and you accept responsibility for all other loss or damage. If you do not accept either LDW or PDW, you owe for all loss or damage to the car. Loss and damage are described in paragraph 13 below. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOUR OWN INSURANCE MAY COVER LOSS OR DAMAGE TO THE CAR. YOU ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE READING THE NOTICE ON LOSS OR DAMAGE SHOWN ON THE RENTAL CONTRACT, OR IN THESE TERMS, OR IN A SEPARATE NOTICE FORM, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE STATE SPECIFIC NOTICES SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH 36 WITH RESPECT TO THE STATE IN WHICH YOU RENTED THE CAR AND EACH STATE WHERE YOU TAKE THE CAR.</p>

    <h3>22. Damage to/Loss of the Car</h3>

    <p>If you do not accept a Loss Damage Waiver, or if the car is lost or damaged as a direct or indirect or damaged as a result of an act of nature, you are responsible and you will pay us for all loss of or damage to the car regardless of cause, or who, or what caused it. If the car is damaged, you will pay our estimated repair cost, or if, in our sole discretion, we determine to sell the car in its damaged condition, you will pay the difference between the car’s retail fair market value before it was damaged and the sale proceeds, you will pay the greater of the car's retail fair market value or its value on our books of account (also known as depreciated book value) before theft or, in the case of damage, the sales proceeds. Depreciated book value may be higher than retail fair market value. Where permitted by law, you authorize us to charge you for the actual cost of repair or replacement of lost or damaged items such as glass, mirrors, tires, and antenna, as part of your rental charges at the time of return. If the car is stolen and not recovered, you will pay us the car’s fair market value before it was stolen. As part of our loss, you’ll also pay for loss of use of the car, without regard to our fleet utilization, plus an administrative fee, plus towing and storage charges, if any (“Incidental Loss”). If your responsibility is covered by any insurance, credit card benefit, travel insurance or such other insurance or benefits, you authorize us to contact the benefit provider directly on your behalf and you assign all of your benefits directly to us to recover all consequential and incidental damages, including but not limited to the repairs of the car plus diminished value or the fair market retail value of the car (less salvage value plus costs incurred in the salvage-sale), and all Incidental Loss and administrative fees. If we collect our loss from a third party after we have collected our loss from you, we will refund the difference, if any, between what you paid us and what we collected from the third party. If the law of a jurisdiction covering this rental requires conditions on LDW that are different than the terms of the Rental Agreement, such as if your liability for ordinary negligence is limited by such law, that law prevails. You understand that you are not authorized to repair or have the car repaired without our express prior written consent. If you repair or have the car repaired without our consent, you will pay the estimated cost to restore the car to the condition it was in prior to your rental. If we authorize you to have the car repaired and the cost of repair is our responsibility, we will reimburse you for those repairs only if you give us the repair receipt.</p>

    <h3>23. Prohibited Use of the Car</h3>

    <p>Certain uses of the car and other actions you or a driver may take, or fail to take, will violate the Rental Agreement. <b>A VIOLATION OF THIS PARAGRAPH, WILL AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATE YOUR RENTAL AND IS AN EXCLUSION TO AND VOIDS ALL LIABILITY PROTECTION AND ANY OPTIONAL SERVICES THAT YOU HAVE ACCEPTED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO SUPPLEMENTAL LIABILITY INSURANCE, PERSONAL ACCIDENT INSURANCE, PERSONAL EFFECTS INSURANCE, ANY ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE PLAN, EMERGENCY SICKNESS PROTECTION AND LOSS DAMAGE WAIVER (LDW) OR PARTIAL DAMAGE WAIVER. IT ALSO MAKES YOU LIABLE TO US FOR ALL PENALTIES, FINES, FORFEITURES, LIENS AND RECOVERY AND STORAGE COSTS, INCLUDING ALL RELATED ATTORNEYS' FEES, LEGAL EXPENSES, FEES AND COSTS THAT WE MAY INCUR. It is a violation of this Paragraph if any of the following occurs:</b></p>

    <p><b>A. You use or permit the car to be used: 1) by anyone other than an authorized driver, as defined in (Rules and Restrictions) to carry passengers or property for hire or more passengers than the car has seat belts to carry; 3) to tow or push anything; 4) to be operated in a test, race or contest or on unpaved roads; 5) while the driver is under the influence of alcohol, any controlled substance, including without limitation, any  federally controlled substance listed under the Controlled Substance Act, Title 21 of the United States Code (a "Controlled Substance"), or medications that affect vehicle operation and/or constitute driving while impaired under applicable law; 6) for conduct that could be charged as a crime such as a felony or misdemeanor, including the transportation of a Controlled Substance or contraband, stolen goods, illegal devices, or persons protected by prohibitions against human trafficking; 7) recklessly or while overloaded; or 8) Ourvehiclecannot be driven into Mexico. B. You or an additional driver, whether authorized or not: 1) fail to promptly report to RRR SUV RENTAL any damage to or loss of the car when it occurs or when you learn of it and provide us with a written accident/incident report or fail to cooperate with our investigation; 2) Where required by law, failed to report an accident to law enforcement; 3) obtained the car through fraud or misrepresentation; 4) leave the car and fail to remove the keys (or key fobs) or close and lock all doors, close all windows and the trunk and the car is stolen or vandalized; or 5) intentionally or with willful disregard cause or allow damage to the car.  C. You or an additional driver, whether authorized or not return the car after hours and the car is damaged, stolen or vandalized or you otherwise fail to take reasonable steps to secure the car, its keys, key fobs, or other remote entry and starting devices.  D. Driving or operating this car while using a hand-held wireless communication device or other device that is capable of receiving or transmitting telephonic communications, electronic data, mail or text messages shall be deemed a breach of the Rental Agreement.</b></p>

    <h3>24. Fuel Service Charge</h3>

    <p>Most rentals come with a full tank of fuel, but that is not always the case.</p>

    <p>a) If you do not accept the fuel service option, where available, at the beginning of your rental, and you return the car with less fuel than was in it when you received it, as we determine in our sole discretion, we will charge you a fuel service charge at the applicable rate per-mile or rate per-gallon specified on the Rental Contract or disclosed at the location. The per-mile rate is used if you do not buy fuel during the rental. To calculate this amount, we multiply the number of miles driven, as shown on the car’s odometer (or provided by the vehicle's telematics device), times the per-mile rate shown on the Rental Contract. The per gallon rate is used if you buy fuel during the rental and provide us with a receipt on our request, but the tank is not as full when you return the car as when you received the car (by using the factory installed gauge, rounded down to the nearest 1/8 tank), times the per-gallon rate shown on the Rental Contract.</p>

    <p>Although two methods are used for ease of calculation, the per mile and per-gallon rates produce approximately the same result. Some of our cars are equipped with onboard telematics which record the actual amounts of fuel in the gas tank. In the event your car has such a device, you will be charged for the actual amount of gasoline needed to fill the tank based on the reading of this device.</p>

    <p>b) If you accept the fuel service option at the beginning of your rental, you will be charged as shown on the rental document for that purchase and you will not pay us a fuel service charge. If you choose this option, you will not incur an additional fuel service charge, but you will not receive any credit for fuel left in the tank at the time of return. If you accept the partial fuel service option at the beginning of your rental, you will be charged as shown on the Rental Contract for that purchase and you will pay a fuel service charge for any fuel not covered by the partial fuel service option. The per-gallon cost of the fuel service option will always be lower than the fuel service charge. The cost of refueling the car yourself at a local service station may be lower than the fuel service charge or the fuel service option. You acknowledge that the fuel service charge is not a retail sale of fuel.</p>

    <p>c) You may avoid a fuel service charge if you return the car with the fuel tank as full as when you received it and, if requested by us, present a receipt for your fuel purchase. If you put fuel into the car, you must use the correct fuel (having the grade of gasoline stated on the car fuel information decal, or on-road diesel). Do not use ethanol fuel even if the car states that it is a flex-fuel vehicle.</p>

    <h3>25. e-Toll</h3>

    <p>If you do not pay cash for tolls or the roadway does not accept cash payment, you automatically opt into our e-Toll service, pursuant to which you agree to pay us or our toll program administrator, with whom we will share your credit card/debit information, for all tolls incurred during your rental and all related fees, charges and penalties. Under the e-Toll program, once you pass through an electronic toll, you will pay a convenience fee of $3.95 for each day of the entire rental period, including any days on which e-Toll is not used, up to a maximum of $19.75 per rental month, plus incurred tolls at the maximum prevailing rates posted by the toll authority. You can avoid the convenience fee and any other charges by paying the toll in cash, using your own electronic toll device, or avoiding any cashless toll road or passage. The e-Toll charges may take 4-8 weeks after the rental concludes to be billed to your credit card/debit card on file.</p>

    <h3>26. Fines, Expenses, Costs and Administrative Fees</h3>

    <p>You’ll pay or reimburse us for all fines, penalties, interest, and court costs for parking, traffic, toll and other violations, including storage liens and charges incurred as a result of your rental. You will also pay a reasonable administrative fee with respect to any violation of the Rental Agreement, such as for repossessing or recovering the car for any reason.  You agree we may, in our sole discretion, pay all tickets, citations, fines, penalties and interest on your behalf directly to the appropriate authority and you will pay us for what we paid to the appropriate authority or their designated agents plus a reasonable administrative fee and any attorneys' fees and expenses we incur. You agree and acknowledge that we cooperate with all federal, state/provincial, municipal, and local officials charged with enforcing these infractions to provide any information necessary as they may request or may otherwise be required.</p>

    <p>You authorize us to release the rental and credit/debit card information regarding your rental to RRR SUV RENTAL, or another agent we authorize to act on our behalf for the purpose of processing and billing you for any tickets, citations, fines and penalties incurred by you or assessed against us or the car during your rental plus a reasonable administrative fee not to exceed $50 per violation. You authorize as our agent we appoint to bill you directly to the credit/debit card you used to rent the car. You authorize our agent we authorize to contact you directly regarding any tickets, citations, fines and penalties incurred by your or assessed against us or to our car while the car was rented to you.</p>

    <p>In the event we use a third-party collection service or agent to resolve any tickets, citations, fines, penalties, and interest, you agree to pay all costs and collection fees including but not limited to administrative and legal costs to such agent upon demand without protest. You acknowledge that you have no right to contest any such infraction or enter any plea other than guilty or no contest unless we consent to your action, provided that the penalty for the infraction is only the payment of money and does not involve any other administrative, civil, or criminal penalty.</p>

    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us or any other agent we authorize harmless for any such tickets, citations, fines, penalties, interest and administrative fees.</p>

    <h3>27. Roadside Assistance</h3>

    <p>Roadside assistance is available to all renters. In some instances, you may purchase added protection under a roadside assistance plan (a "Roadside Assistance") in which RRR SUV RENTAL offers to cover potential costs associated with lost keys, remote entry devices, lockouts, flat tires, towing (if the car becomes inoperable), jump starts, or emergency fuel delivery (up to 3 gallons). If you do not purchase the Roadside Assistance Plan in advance, you may incur added costs for providing the above referenced services. When paying in advance for a Roadside Assistance Plan, you will pay for any full or partial day at the rate specified in the Rental Contract.  There are no refunds if you do not use the Roadside Assistance Plan. Once purchased, you cannot cancel or rescind the Roadside Assistance Plan during the rental.</p>

    <h3>28. Personal Accident and Effects Insurance (PAE). </h3>

    <p>You’ll pay for PAE and PAE-Plus (where available) if you accept it.  You understand that you will be charged the PAE rate per day for a full day even if you don’t have the car the entire day. Visit www.budget.com for additional information, terms and coverage limits.</p>

    <h3>29. Liability Protection</h3>

    <p>Anyone driving the car who is permitted to drive it by the Rental Agreement will be protected against liability for causing bodily injury or death to others or damaging the property of someone other than the authorized driver and/or the renter up to the minimum financial responsibility limits required by the law of the jurisdiction in which the accident occurs.  The limit for bodily injury sustained by any one person includes any claim for loss of that person’s consortium or services. Where applicable law extends this protection to a non-Permitted Driver, the same limits will apply. <b>Except where required by law to be primary or excess, any protection provided by us shall be secondary to, and not in excess of, any applicable insurance available to you, or any other driver, from any other source, whether primary, excess, secondary or contingent in any way.</b> If this protection is extended by operation of law to anyone not permitted by the Rental Agreement to drive the car, or to any person or instance where coverage is not intended to be afforded by the Rental Agreement, the financial responsibility limits of the jurisdiction in which the accident occurred will apply.</p>
