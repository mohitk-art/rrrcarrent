</p>
  

  
  <h3>BINDING ARBITRATION</h3>
  
  <p >You agree that any controversy or claim arising
  out of or relating to the Site or Mobile App or use of the Site or Mobile App
  or these Terms, other than claims relating to infringement of copyright or
  other intellectual property, may only be settled by binding arbitration in
  accordance with the Paragraph or alternatively, you may assert your claims in
  small claims court if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in
  such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative)
  basis. &nbsp;The arbitration must be held in a location determined by the
  arbitrator as set forth herein (provided that such location is reasonably
  convenient for you), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon
  by the parties, in accordance with the applicable procedural rules set forth in
  the then prevailing Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS
  (“JAMS Rules and Procedures”), and judgment upon the award rendered by the
  arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
  &nbsp;The JAMS Rules and Procedures are available at <a
  href="http://www.jamsadr.com">www.jamsadr.com</a> or by calling
  (800) 352-5267.&nbsp; The arbitrator must be selected pursuant to the JAMS
  Rules and Procedures. &nbsp;The arbitrator shall apply Missouri law consistent
  with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations and
  shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law.&nbsp; If you initiate
  arbitrations against RRR SUV RENTAL, you will not be responsible for
  professional fees for the arbitrator’s services or any other JAMS fees.&nbsp;
  If you are able to demonstrated that the costs of arbitration will be
  cost-prohibitive or greater than the costs of litigation, National will pay as
  much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the
  arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being
  cost-prohibitive or more expensive than the cost of litigation.&nbsp; If any
  part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or
  illegal (other than that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or
  representative basis), or otherwise conflicts with the rules and procedures
  established by JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision remains in
  effect and must be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid,
  unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.
  &nbsp;If, however, the portion that is deemed invalid, unenforceable or illegal
  is that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, then
  the entirety of this arbitration provision is null and void, and neither you
  nor RRR SUV RENTAL is entitled to arbitrate their dispute.&nbsp; <b>THE
  ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PURSUANT TO THIS PARAGRAPH MUST BE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL
  CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
  REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. &nbsp;THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE
  CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED.</b>
</p>
  

  
 <p><b>BY AGREEING TO THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES
  AS SET FORTH HEREIN, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL
  AND LIMITING YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR
  RIGHTS TO MAINTAIN OTHER AVAILABLE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, SUCH AS A COURT
  ACTION.</b></p>
  

  
  <h3>GENERAL</h3>

  <p>
  If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be invalid or unenforceable,
  that provision must be construed consistent with applicable law, and the
  remaining provisions must be enforced. Headings are for reference purposes only
  and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope of such section.
  Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms of Use shall not constitute
  a waiver of that or any other provision. These Terms of Use set forth the
  entire agreement between you and RRR SUV RENTAL in connection with your use of
  the Site or Mobile App.
